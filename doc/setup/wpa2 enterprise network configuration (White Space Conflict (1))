After getting the network information through sudo ifconfig and sudo route -n, I have inserted the line 

iface default inet dhcp

at the end onf the file etc/network/interfaces

After that, I the file 

/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf 

was cinfigured as following:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
        ssid="NP Hawks WPA"
        proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        pairwise=CCMP
        auth_alg=OPEN
        eap=PEAP
        identity=MY_USERNAME
        password=MY_PASSWORD
}
